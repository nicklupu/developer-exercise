# Warehouse Web Developer Exercise

In this excercise we would like you to build a web component similar to this [screenshot](recommendation_screenshot.png) using the [JSON](data/recommendations.json) provided. Creativity is accepted but do not alter the JSON. The componet you build should display images, prices and link to the product taking into consideration how it would work with i18n.

### Requirements
* Responsive
* Reusable code

Please fork this repository and commit your changes for review.

I have used Grunt and Pug to compile my page, the gruntfile reads the JSON and then creates an index page using the data. I also used the SCSS bootstrap 4 template for styling.
